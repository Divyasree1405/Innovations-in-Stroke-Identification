#  Innovations in Stroke Identification

This project focuses on **early stroke prediction and identification** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It is developed as part of my **B.Tech Final Year Project**.  

#  Project Overview
Stroke is a medical emergency, and early detection can save lives.  
In this project, I built a machine learning model that predicts the chances of stroke based on medical and lifestyle parameters.  

The project includes:  
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
- Machine Learning Model Training (using scikit-learn)  
- Flask Web Application** for user-friendly interaction  
- Visualization of Results
  
 Quick Setup:
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py 

Then open browser â†’ http://127.0.0.1:5000/
